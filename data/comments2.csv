Seeking private profit may become more dependent on political power as seeking more political influence requires adequate means and resources, the latter gained with the help of criminal activities",Values,"Legitimacy is a big deal for terrorists (with external and constituency functions). That's why combating terrorism (and, more important, dealing with people who feel sympathetic with terrorist acts of violence) is very much about the competition of values (including human rights, civility, peace, cultural diversity and empathy etc.)",Middle East & North Africa,"The conflicts in the middle east and the particular strength of radical ideologies in this region are (considered) drivers of terrorism. The actors in the region have a very much conflict-based understanding of terrorism and its legitimacy. And many of them perceive external actors (interveners) as the truly terrorists.

(For those that cannot afford the fair market price see humanitarian assistance under point 5 below).  In order to have fair and proper distribution the world needs trade, whether it be national, regional or international trade to distribute foodstuffs.  Trade requires infrastructure, rule of law, etc.  Without trade everyone is forced to be a food producer, something that is not viable.",Urbanization,"I include urbanization as part of fair and proper distribution of foodstuffs because of the remarkable change in population between rural and urban areas.  The UN epects rural population to shrink, not only in percentage terms but in absolute numbers over the next 40 years.  As urban population grows from 3.5 billion to 6.5 billion in the next 40 years the challenge of food trade and distribution to the cities needs to be carefully understood.",Humanitarian Assistance,"Regardless of how successful the world is at reducing poverty, I am under no illusion that we can eliminate poverty.  Therefore some element of humanitarian assistance needs to be part of food security.

Furthermore, the Earth's ocean is central to the conditions experienced on our planet, regulating its atmosphere, climate and biology. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the physical and chemical conditions within the ocean are changing in ways that are rapidly moving outside those experienced for millions of years with major changes to ocean temperature, acidity, sea ice extent, sea level, and storm intensity.   These changes are impacting the biological components the ocean, including an array of important microbial systems.  Observed changes so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, declining abundances of habitat forming species such as oysters, mangroves and corals, species range shifts, and an increased incidence of disease and invasion by exotic species.  These changes to the marine biosphere are also beginning to amplify changes within major nutrient cycles, adding to impacts driven by other human activities such as coastal land use and overfishing.  As we continue to push carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, there is also growing uncertainty as to the risks associated with passing non-linear triggers and tipping points.
